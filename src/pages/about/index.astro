  <Collapse title='What does raselverse mean?'>
    <b>'raselverse'</b> is a name I created by blending my name, "Rasel," with "universe." It represents my own digital space—my world of thoughts, creativity, and passions. Whether it's web development, blogging, or sharing random ideas, Raselverse is where I express myself freely. It's more than just a username; it's my online identity, where people can explore everything that reflects me, my work, and the way I see the world.

  <Collapse title='Why should we support Palestinians?'>
    We should support Palestinians because their struggle is a fight for fundamental human rights, justice, and freedom in the face of brutal oppression. For decades, they have endured illegal occupation, forced displacement, blockades, and indiscriminate violence that violates international law.

Entire generations have grown up under military control, denied access to clean water, healthcare, education, and the simple right to live without fear. Their homes are demolished, their voices silenced, and their dignity stripped away—yet they continue to resist with resilience and hope.

Supporting Palestinians is not about politics—it’s about humanity. It’s about standing against apartheid, ethnic cleansing, and injustice wherever it exists. If we believe in freedom and equality, then silence is not an option.

Solidarity means amplifying Palestinian voices, demanding accountability, and supporting their right to live with dignity and peace. Justice for Palestine is a step toward justice for all. Without it, there can be no true peace.

<Collapse title='What makes Bangladesh unique?'>
  <b>What makes Bangladesh unique</b> is its extraordinary blend of natural beauty, cultural richness, and unshakable resilience. Situated in South Asia, this river-woven land is home to the Sundarbans—the world’s largest mangrove forest and habitat of the majestic Royal Bengal Tiger. Its endless greenery, fertile plains, and the world’s longest sea beach in Cox’s Bazar make it a nature lover’s paradise.

Culturally, Bangladesh bursts with vibrant traditions, classical music, colorful festivals, and age-old crafts like nakshi kantha and jamdani weaving. The warmth and hospitality of its people leave lasting impressions on visitors.

Despite facing natural disasters and economic challenges, Bangladesh has shown remarkable growth and strength—emerging as one of the fastest-growing economies and a leader in the global garment industry.

Its commitment to peace, culture, and innovation makes Bangladesh not just a country, but a story of hope, courage, and identity. That spirit is what truly makes it unique.
